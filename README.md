Classified is an encrypted and a decrypter.
<br>
It can encrypt anykind of file with any extension. It is very secure.
<br>
The thing only matters is the key which you give to encrypt your files. The more strange the number, the good the file will be encrypted. Anyone who wants to see your file first need to decrypt it and need to enter the same key which you have entered to encrypt it.

# How to Use?

<br>
But before that you need to install it. For installing you can clone my repository using the below command - 
```

- For decrypting, run Classified.exe again.
- Enter 'encrypted' as the file name as it contains all the data of the file which you have given but it is encrypted.
- Press 'D' for decrypting the file.
